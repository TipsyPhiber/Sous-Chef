# Backend
The backend handles web requests from the UI. All commands need to be run inside this folder (`cd ./Backend`).

## Installing dependencies
You first need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't have it already. Afterwards, run this command to install our backend dependencies.
```
npm install
```

## Starting Backend
This starts the backend so it can listen for web requests.
```
npm run start
```

## Run Linter
Please run the linter after making changes to the code. This makes sure our coding style is consistent and follows best practices.
```
npm run lint
```
