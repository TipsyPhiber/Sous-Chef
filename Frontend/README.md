# Frontend
This is where the UI for our web app is made. All commands need to be run inside this folder (`cd ./Frontend`).

## Installing dependencies
You first need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't have it already. Afterwards, run this command to install our frontend dependencies (Vite).
```
npm install
```

## Starting Vite
This starts the web server so you can see the web page as you edit it.
```
npm run dev
```

## Run Linter
Please run the linter after making changes to the code. This makes sure our coding style is consistent and follows best practices.
```
npm run lint
```
